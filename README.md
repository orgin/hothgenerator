This is a world/terrain generator intended to be used with the minecraft bukkit server software.

This generator will produce an icy world with a thick ice and snow layer and the occational snow
covered mountain. Hidden below you might find tiny caves where life that once inhabited the surface
still surviving and perhaps you'll find strange structures left over from some ancient civilization.
